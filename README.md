# Neovim configuration files
This is a directory that contains a bunch of configuration files for my neovim setup.
This configuration is currently configured and tested for linux wayland.  
To use it outside of wayland and linux, change the clipboard manager specified at `init.lua` and change the option for `vim.g.clipboard`.

This also contains a plugin I made by myself for a window that provides renaming in a way I like.
